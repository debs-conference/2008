</p>
<p class="tutorial"> Two convincing paradigms have emerged for achieving scalability in widely distributed systems: publish/subscribe communication between loosely coupled components and role-based, policy-driven control of access to the system by applications.

A strength of pub/sub is its many-to-many communication paradigm where publishers need not know the recipients of their data and subscribers need not know the number and location of publishers. But some data is sensitive, and its visibility must be controlled carefully for personal and legal reasons. Also, databases may subscribe to events for the persistent record as well as subscribers concerned with realtime response. We describe the requirements of several application domains where the event-based paradigm is appropriate yet where security is an issue. Typical are the large-scale systems required by government and public bodies for domains such as healthcare, police, transport and environmental monitoring.

We discuss how a pub/sub communication service can be secured; firstly by specifying and enforcing access control policy at the service API, and secondly by enforcing the security and privacy aspects of these policies within the service itself. We outline our investigations and findings from several research projects in these areas and highlight remaining challenges.</p>

	<i>Dieter Gawlick, Shailendra Mishra</i> - Oracle
</p>
<p class="tutorial">During the last few years CEP has become the focus of managing events; consequently CEP is in a process of a rapid evolution. There are several ways to support CEP; arguably the most promising approach is CQL (Continuous Query Language), an extension of SQL. CQL provides support for collections of data called streams; streams are sets of time ordered tuples. CQL allows users to supervise permanently a set of streams and to determine if a new element of a result set has been found due to newly arrived tuples or the elapse of time. If one considers the tuples in streams as events, an element in the result set of a CQL represent a complex event. 

CQL allows researchers, developers and users to leverage their knowledge of the very rich and well understood SQL technology. By accessing and manipulating streams as well as classical SQL data in a single statement CQL integrates CEP fully into existing data processing technology. The CQL technology has matured and found its way into products of start-up companies as well as into well established companies and their application suites.

The tutorial provides an in-depth discussion of CQL, the data model, the language and the implementation. Additionally, the creations of original streams, the dissemination of streams as well as the management of streams as part of large and highly flexible EPN (Event Processing Networks) will be discussed. The material will be illustrated with several use cases. </p>

	<h6><a name="amk"></a>Large-scale publish-subscribe systems: state of the art and research directions</h6>
	<i>Peter Triantafillou</i> - University of Patras, Department of Computer Engineering and Informatics<br>
	<i>Anne-Marie Kermarrec</i> - INRIA Rennes, Bretagne Atlantique
</p>
<p class="tutorial">Publish-subscribe systems are event-based systems receiving increasing attention in several disciplines in modern computer science, ranging from distributed computing where it is viewed as an appealing alternative to traditional remote procedure call infrastructures, to information systems where it is viewed as a natural computing paradigm that enables users to filter the enormous volumes of information produced nowadays and delivers only information that is truly relevant to them. In such systems, subscribers register their interests in specific (possibly data-carrying) events and are asynchronously notified of any matching event published by publishers. Subscribers and publishers are decoupled in space and time and the system is in charge of mapping events to matching subscriptions and ensuring the delivery of events to users with matched subscriptions. Publish-subscribe systems differ in the degree of expressiveness they offer to subscribers: subscribers may subscribe to events by indicating a name, a set of keywords, or a set of tuples of attribute-value pairs.

The publish-subscribe paradigm is inherently scalable, yet the key to fully realizing and exploiting its scalability lies on a (fully) decentralized (also called peer to peer) architecture. This is in contrast to server-based architectures. Several classes of distributed publish-subscribe architectures have been proposed in the research literature, ranging from unstructured (typically gossip-based) to fully structured (a.k.a. DHT-based). The differences typically reflect variants in functionalities with respect to the expressiveness of the subscriptions that can be supported, as well as the efficiency of the underlying dissemination and maintenance schemes.

The aim of this tutorial, in a nutshell, is for participants to take home an understanding of the overall solution design space, the positions occupied in this space by most well-known works in the area, and the related solution trade-offs.</p>

	<h6><a name="querzoni"></a>Interest clustering techniques for efficient event routing in large-scale settings</h6>
	<i>Leonardo Querzoni</i> - Sapienza University of Rome, Department of Computer and Systems Sciences
</p>
<p class="tutorial">The adoption of middleware platforms providing publish/subscribe based communication primitives is today restricted to specific settings characterized by a limited set of dedicated machines usually managed by some central administrator. The birth of new applications that run continuously on a huge number of non dedicated nodes (system monitoring for large enterprises, internet-based collaborative applications, etc.) raised the need for a new generation of publish/subscribe systems. These systems must be able to cope with a very large population of heterogeneous nodes, with unreliable shared network channels, and, with a dynamic environment whose characteristics can change over time.

One of the most important problems these system must deal with is how to efficiently route each event to the set of intended recipients despite the fact that this set can be very small (one subscriber) or really large (up to tens of thousands of nodes) and its composition can change over time. A technique that is widely adopted in modern event routing mechanisms to improve efficiency is interest clustering: nodes sharing similar interests have a good probability to receive similar events, thus it makes sense to cluster them as much as possible in the system in order to reduce the number of distinct paths that must be traveled by an event to reach them. 

With this tutorial we want to illustrate how interest clustering is adopted and implemented in various publish/subscribe systems to improve the performance of their event routing mechanisms.</p>

	<h6><a name="chakravarthy"></a>Events and Streams: Harnessing and Unleashing Their Synergy</h6>
	<i>Sharma Chakravarthy</i> - University of Texas at Arlington, Computer Science and Engineering Department
</p>
<p class="tutorial">Although the research on event processing started a long time ago, there is a renewed impetus on complex event processing. Separately, stream processing has been researched more recently and a number of techniques and systems have been developed. However, the differences and similarities between the two have not been well understood. For example, the QoS requirements that are extremely important for stream applications has not been addressed in the context of events. In addition, the synergy that exists between the two and that the combination can be greater than the sum of its parts has tremendous impact on a large class of sensor-based applications.<br />

In this tutorial, we first discuss underpinnings of complex event processing, stream processing, and their similarities and differences. We will discuss the primary techniques that have been developed for the two topics. We will then discuss the alternatives for the integration of the two as most of the applications will require both stream and event processing. Finally, we will discuss a few commercial and prototype systems to understand what features have been incorporated into these systems. We will highlight the research issues in both the areas and what have been addressed and what is still open.<br />

We will cover the following topics in detail during the tutorial: Complex event processing fundamentals, stream processing fundamentals, similarities and differences between the two, why their integration is needed,and synergistic integration of the two. How different commercial and research systems have tackled this problem. Implementation of an event/stream processing system will also be covered using the implementation of MavEStream at UTA. Some of the work can be found at http://itlab.uta.edu/sharma under publications.

	<h6><a name="corsaro"></a>The OMG Data Distribution Service for Real-Time Systems</h6>
	<i>Angelo Corsaro</i> - PrismTech
</p>
<p class="tutorial">The Data Distribution Service for Real-Time Systems (DDS) is a  relatively new standard, adopted by the Object Management  Group in 2004. DDS  has experienced an extremely swift adoption due to (1) its ability to address challenging  requirements of real-time and high throughput data distribution in business- and mission-critical systems, such as financial services, air-traffic management and control, and next-generation military land and naval combat systems, and (2) its support for complex QoS along with data centric features typical of Complex Event Processing platforms, such as,  relational information modeling, continuous queries, topic projection, and windows. This tutorial will provide an in depth overview of the DDS, explaining its unique data-centric approach, as well as its extremely rich support for QoS controlling every aspect of data distribution, timeliness, and availability. The tutorial will conclude presenting some of the most important DDS Design Patterns, and providing an outlook of the upcoming extensions to the standard, and research challenges.</p>
